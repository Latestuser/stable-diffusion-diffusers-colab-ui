# Stable Diffusion with Colab UI

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/oneir0mancer/stable-diffusion-diffusers-colab-ui/blob/main/sd_diffusers_colab_ui.ipynb)

Since Google Colab now profibits running stable diffusion WebUI, this repository aims to emulate WebUI using just Colab and it's UI widgets, without running a web server. 

There are some major problems with supporting Automatic1111 format models, textual invertions, LoRAs, etc. Will see if it's something that can be fixed.
